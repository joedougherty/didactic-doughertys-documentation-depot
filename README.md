# Didactic Dougherty's Documentation Depot #


Hello folks!

As you likely know, I'm a documentation-loving fool! 

I thoroughly enjoy tackling new technical topics and writing down my findings. 

It helps me to keep myself interested and to expand my horizons.


## What Is This? ##


**An Open Invitation to Suggest a Topic for Me to Write On.** 

I'm offering this service to YOU!  

That's right -- I'm offering bespoke, hand-hewn writings that help to explain/explore some small topic that YOU want to know about! 

Don't currently have the free time or energy to begin to investigate a new topic? Maybe I'll do it?! 


## The Deets ##


If I find your question / topic captures my attention I'll:

* do a write-up on some aspect(s) of it 

* document any references I used while researching 

* post it here on the internet as part of this repository

*Works will be licensed under the [Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International License](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/legalcode) as applicable.*

* [A Strange, Yet Earnest Attempt to Explain Georg Cantor's Transfinite Cardinality ... by way of Python Generators](https://github.com/joedougherty/writing/blob/drafts/the_generator_that_could_not_be.rst). (This one is incomplete, ambititous, and _out there_.) Not a typical example.


## Disclaimer ##

---

This is a project: 

1.) that exists largely for my own personal edification

_but also_...

2.) that exists so I can try to give back (in some small way) to folks who've given so much to me

I'd kindly ask you to not suggest topics specific to any employer current or previous. Thank you!

Other than that, suggest away! I look forward to hearing from you.
